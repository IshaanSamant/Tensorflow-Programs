# Tensorflow-Programs
A compilation of self programs that go through the basic applications of tensorflow in programs.
For the first two programs we use the Fashion mnist dataset which has already been split into the 
training and testing data, we just have to make a network to detect which obejct is present out of 
a class of 10 total objects.

# Convolution
The CNN is created on a dataset called CIFAR-10 there are certain convolution layers and they are
connected to a set of dense layers to process the convoluted data and help us classify the data.
